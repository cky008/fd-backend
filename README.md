## Abstract
FooDelivery (FD) is a web-based food delivery platform that leverages the most up-to-date technologies, including NestJS, GraphQL, WebSockets, Typescript, and React, to provide a sophisticated developer experience and engaging user experience. Similar to popular food delivery platforms like Just Eat and Deliveroo, FD caters to multiple user types, including customers, owners, and couriers, each with a personalized dashboard displaying content tailored to their specific needs. For example, customers can easily place a food order, make payments, and receive notification of its status. On the other hand, owners can manage their food orders, analyze sales data, and make informed decisions based on the data analysis tools provided by FD. Additionally, FD integrates with Paddle for secure online payment processing and Mailgun for efficient email communication, offering users convenient payment and communication options. To enhance the delivery experience, FD allows customers to view the planned delivery route on Google Maps and receive updates on its status. With its advanced technology and user-friendly features, FD aims to provide a seamless and efficient food delivery experience for all its users.
